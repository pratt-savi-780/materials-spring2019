            <h1>Assignment 1: HTML</h1>
        </header>

        <section>
            <p><strong>Due January 28 at 6pm</strong></p>
            <p>We talked about HTML this week, and we'll exercise some of our new knowledge around it by using HTML to make our own pages.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Resources</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>My <a id="" href="/files/html_cheatsheet.pdf">HTML Reference</a> should get you started.</li>
                <li>Codecademy has a course: <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html">Learn HTML</a> (Just do the first section, "Elements and Structure", don't bother with the pro lessons).</li>
                <li><a href="https://marksheet.io/">MarkSheet</a> has a good free HTML tutorial.</li>
                <li>If you're looking for a resource on HTML that you can read through, I'd recommend the first three chapters of <a href="https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/">HTML &amp; CSS is Hard</a>. For now I would stick with editing code in Glitch, so you can skip the parts that mention a text editor named Atom.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Create a page with HTML</h2>
            <p>Let's create an webpage from scratch using HTML. Pick something you're interested in and make a one-page site in Glitch about that topic.</p>
            <p>We have not yet covered CSS, which will add style to an HTML page. <strong>Please do not spend time styling your page for this assignment. Stick to HTML for now.</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create a site <a href="https://glitch.com/">in Glitch</a>.</li>
                <li>Edit the HTML page (<strong>index.html</strong>):
                    <ul>
                        <li>add some text</li>
                        <li>add at least one image (upload it to Glitch first)</li>
                        <li>add at least one link</li>
                        <li>experiment with some other HTML tags as outlined in the HTML Reference</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Submit a link to the public page on Glitch (not the link you use for editing).</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

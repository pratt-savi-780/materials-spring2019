            <h1>Assignment 3: JavaScript</h1>
        </header>

        <section>
            <p><strong>Due February 11 at 6pm</strong></p>
            <p>We talked more about JavaScript this week, and we'll exercise some of our new knowledge around it while building upon HTML and CSS.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Resources</h2>
            <p>The JavaScript resources suggested last week still apply:
                <ul>
                    <li>The Khan Academy <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">Intro to JavaScript online course</a> is popular</li>
                    <li>Codecademy's <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript">Introduction to JavaScript is also worthwhile</a></li>
                    <li>NodeSchool has a series of exercises written in Glitch projects called <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/javascripting">JavaScripting</a></li>
                    <li>If you're looking for a resource on JavaScript that you can read through, the first few chapters of <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript</a> is a good source. It goes a little more in depth than you need to right now, so feel free to skip and skim parts of it.</li>
                    <li>Another readable resource is <a href="http://javascript.info/">javascript.info</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://gitbookio.gitbooks.io/javascript/">Learn JavaScript</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://jsforcats.com/">JavaScript for Cats</a></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Focus on the core concepts of JavaScript: variables, arrays, objects, and functions.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Create a map using more advanced JavaScript and Leaflet features</h2>
            <p>This week we covered advanced JavaScript and Leaflet features such as popups, feature styling, filtering, and events. This assignment is an opportunity to apply each of these to either your map from last time or a new one.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Decide whether you are creating a new map for this assignment or extending your map from the last assignment. Either way, create a new Glitch app for this assignment&mdash;you can remix your app from the last assignment.</li>
                <li>Add popups to the map that provide more information about the features.</li>
                <li>Style the popups with CSS.</li>
                <li>Style the features.</li>
                <li>Use event listeners to respond to an event of your choosing and change the map in some way. For example, this could be a link or button on your page that filters the data on the map when it is clicked. It could also be some HTML form input that filters the data in a more complex way, or an event that is more specific to Leaflet such as a click on a feature.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Final project proposal</h2>
            <p>Flesh out your thoughts for one of your project ideas from last time. See the <a href="final.html">final project assignment</a> for a refresher on what is required. Write about:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The project idea: what is it? why do you want to explore it?</li>
                <li>Data sources you will likely use.</li>
                <li>What features your project will include.</li>
                <li>What you want the project to look like. While not required, a rough sketch of what you want the site to look like is strongly recommended.</li>
                <li>Your timeline for the project. Remember that it is due the last night of class, October 16. Be ambitious but realistic&mdash;what are the phases of the project? What is the bare minimum you could accomplish for the class and while being happy with it? Which parts would you consider continuing to work on after class?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Submit a (1/2- to 1-page) <strong>PDF or Word document</strong> in the upload field set aside for it on the assignment submission form. We will briefly and informally talk about these at the beginning of class on the evening this assignment is due, so please be prepared for that.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Submitting your work</h2>
